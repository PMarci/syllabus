# Module 4 - Understand Objects

## Objectives
As Java focuses on Object Orientation, this module ensures that students have a basic grounding in this core functionality.  Once understood, the course expands to cover some items previously introduced (but not explained) and then expands to cover how objects interact.

__As this week was impacted by the previous module spilling over, we'll do a simpler Demo on Friday as we might need more time to catch up remaining lessons.__

## Overview of Days in this Module
- [Object &amp; Classes](m04d1)
- [Object &amp; Classes: Continuation](m04d2)
- [Regex, I/O and Serialization; Demo day](m04d3)
- [Date, Scanner Class, Localization &amp; Demo](m04d4)

## Knowledge & Skills
The participants are expected to achieve these competences (knowledge and/or skills) by the end of this module:-
- Understanding of Intention and Extension
- Able to create classes with methods and properties
- Understand what "static" means; what "protected" and "private" convey
- Can define an interface and abstract 
- Able to create constructors of varying signatures
- Understand how data is stored for setters; retrieved by getters; and how to use the IDE to generate such
- Can employ a generic; understand how objects box data
- Can explain and integrate threads, demonstrate an understanding of an interface
- Able to use Regex
- Know how to use the File class so as to read and write files and binary streams
- Acquainted with the concept of serialization
- Know about the Date and Scanner classes
- Have a basic understanding of what is meant by localization

## Demo (for end of the module)
By the end of this module, you will be expected to be conversant in the core concepts found in programming (variables, types, loops, expressions, control & functions).
 - Creating a class of objects that inherit 
 - Able to output serialized content of objects
