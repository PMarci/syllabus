# Module 03: Day 3 - ArrayList, LinkedLists, HashMap;  Iterators, Foreach
Working with lists is core to computing; the first computers were little more than engines for sorting tables.  This day will focus on ways of storing and working with those lists.

## Assignment Review


## Topics

### Add in a library
*There's a useful set of routines that exists outside of the main Java built-in statements which, as we are covering arrays, we'd like to loop in.*
- Why are there libraries
- How are they added so that IDEA knows about them
- How do you include them in a program; reference them in the code.

### ArraysLists
- initialise 
  - empty
  - with values
  - using a loop
- add (to the next position, at an index)
- remove (by index, by value)
- size()
- isEmpty
- searching: contains(), containsAll()
- assigning between arrays (*copying* toArray(), addAll())
- casting as string toString()

### LinkedLists
- add(), addFirst(), addLast
- set()
- remove()
- size
- get(), getFirst(), getLast()
### HashSet & HashMaps
#### Add & Put
#### Keyset
#### Remove

### Iterator
### Foreach

### Other well-known types of lists
- Queue
  - push
  - pop
