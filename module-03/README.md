# Module 3 - Introduction Java Basics (Phase 2)

## Objectives
* Become familiar with the typical components of a programming language, using Java as our guide.  This introduces concepts found in all programming languages and lays the foundation on which to then go deeper into the strengths of Java.*

## Overview of Days in this Module
- [Java Environment &amp; Basic Constructs](m03d1-expressions-controlflow)
- [Arrays, Functions and Debugging &amp; Exceptions](m03d2-arrays-collections-functions)
- [ArrayList, LinkedLists, HashMap;  Iterators, Foreach](m03d3)
- [Stringbuilder, Conversion & Casting; Functional Overloading](m03d4)
- [Primitive vs Complex Types (intro to Objects); Data input (aka Scanner); Practicing the Basics](m03d5)

## Knowledge & Skills
*List the competences (knowledge and/or skills) that the participants are expected to master in this module.*
- Turing machine, concepts core to all programming; interpreters, compilers
- The components of the Java world - IDE & program, compile to bytecode, linking, running in the JVM
- Running a Java program; debugging and inspecting variables in an operating program
- Searching and installing a library
- Variables, Data Types
- Expressions
- Control Flow - loops (while, do-while, for), statements (if, if-then, if-then-else, elseif)
- Referencing a library
- Arrays - multi-dimensional, jagged
- Collections - ArrayList & HashMaps
- Functions - parameters, return values, signatures/overloading; main args[]
- Strings & StringBuilder
- Basic I/O - the Scanner class (reading from the prompt (System.in), writing to the prompt (System.out))
- Iterating through collections 
- Data conversion (Autoboxing, unboxing, casting)

## Demo (for end of the module)
*By the end of this module, you will be expected to be conversant in the core concepts found in programming (variables, types, loops, expressions, control & functions).*
 - Creating simple algorithms as searching palindromes in a string, 
 - Show understanding of variables, conditionals, loops and the other basic elements of a programming language.
