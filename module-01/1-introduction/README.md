### Purpose of this workshop
Get a feel of basic HTML and CSS while recreating a simple and nice medium-length article design.
Focus on text styling, basic layout and header image.

### Steps
- __Plan your work.__
  Determine the requirements.  Gather content, images.  Run through the basic HTML structure and make note of how it has been styled.
- __Keep things tidy.__
  Create a folder for all your Greenfox materials.  Then within that, a folder for the first week, and within that a folder for the first day's assignment.
- __Start with the content.__
  Create an index.html file. What are the mandatory tags in an HTML document? See [step1 in the project folder](project/step1)  .
  __Add more content.__
  Copy-paste a few paragraphs of text from [the article above](https://medium.com/galleys/how-she-got-there-3a64d89ba112#.8eknq2olp) to start with.
- __Give it some structure.  __
  What semantic role do these paragraphs fill? Divide it into a few separate HTML tags.
-__ Add in style.  __
  Create a style.css file and link it to your HTML.  
  How do you center content on the page?  
  Try adding a custom font via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Merriweather).  
- __Add a header image.  __
  Try adding an image tag. How do you make it full page wide?  
  Try adding the image as background-image instead.
